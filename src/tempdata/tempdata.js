        description: "Are you fluent at English? Drilleng is going to help you to develop a good understanding of English sentence structure on a deep level. How it works? You will be asked simple yes-or-no questions, on which you are supposed to give a full sentence answer based on the question. Positive or negative it doesn‚Äôt matter! For example: Does your mom love chocolate? You should say: Yes, my mom loves chocolate. Or: No, my mom doesn‚Äôt love chocolate. All questions are generated randomly based on predefined data. The app does also provide you with correct answers in both positive and negative form, so you could check you answer and learn on the fly. Are you ready? Press Go to begin!
